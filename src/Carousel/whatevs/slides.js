        At the center of the photo, a monster young
        star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun is
        blasting powerful ultraviolet radiation and
        hurricane-like stellar winds, carving out a
        fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and
        mountains of gas and dust.

        For the 26th birthday of NASA's Hubble Space
        Telescope, astronomers are highlighting a
        Hubble image of an enormous bubble being
        blown into space by a super-hot, massive
        star. The Hubble image of the Bubble Nebula,
        or NGC 7635, was chosen to mark the 26th
        anniversary of the launch of Hubble into
        Earth orbit by the STS-31 space shuttle crew
        on April 24, 1990.

        The Eagle Nebula pillars are bathed in the
        blistering ultraviolet light from a grouping
        of young, massive stars located off the top
        of the image. Streamers of gas can be seen
        bleeding off the pillars as the intense
        radiation heats and evaporates it into
        space. Denser regions of the pillars are
        shadowing material beneath them from the
        powerful radiation. Stars are being born
        deep inside the pillars, which are made of
        cold hydrogen gas laced with dust. The
        pillars are part of a small region of the
        Eagle Nebula, a vast star-forming region
        6,500 light-years from Earth.
